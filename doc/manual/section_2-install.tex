\subsection{Building}
Sudoken can be built using the Apache Ant (\url{http://ant.apache.org/} -- versions 1.7.x and 1.8.x should work) build-system. Eclipse can also be used, but will not create the plugin JAR files correctly. 

To build, simply navigate to the root project folder (where \texttt{build.xml} is located), and in a console, type:
\begin{verbatim}
	$ ant clean
	$ ant
\end{verbatim}

It is recommended that after changing any files to do an \texttt{ant clean} before compiling.

The application and its support files can be found in the \texttt{build} folder under the root directory.

\subsection{Installing}
Simply copy the \texttt{build} folder (and its subfolders/folders) to a convenient location.
